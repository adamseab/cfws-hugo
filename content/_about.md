<!-- <h2 class="no-anchor">About Me</h2> -->



### Hi folks, I'm Adam - but most call me Seab!  

#### I'm a bit of an aviation and aerospace nerd, so naturally I love travel, planes, being in airports and anything space. I'm also a student private pilot.

*(A typical Sagittarius, if you're into that kind of thing?!)*

I'm a dedicated husband, dad, cat-dad, occasional blogger and photo taker.

I also love gaming, cars, cloud engineering, pro wrestling, still being a PokÃ©mon enthusiast (#SquirtleSquad) and being European. ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º

I'm still constantly learning and gaining confidence in the Cloud Engineering space and I'm finding my footing as a Cloud / DevOps Engineer.  
The 'life goal' was naturally to be a commercial pilot, but as they say, 'life happens' - but fortunately with this new direction, I can still definitely say my *head is very much in the cloud(s)!*
