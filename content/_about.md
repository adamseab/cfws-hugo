title: 'About Seab'

### Hi folks, I'm Adam - but most call me Seab!  

#### I'm a bit of an aviation and aerospace nerd, so naturally I love travel, planes, being in airports and anything space-related. I'm also a student private pilot when I can!

*(A 'typical Sagittarius', if you're into that kind of thing?!)*

I'm a dedicated husband, dad, cat-dad, occasional blogger and photo taker.

I also love gaming, cars, cloud engineering, pro wrestling, still being a PokÃ©mon enthusiast (*#SquirtleSquad*) and being a European citizen. ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º

I'm consistantly learning and gaining confidence in the Cloud Engineering space and I'm continuing my progress as a Cloud / DevOps Engineer.  

The 'life goal' was naturally to be a commercial pilot, but as they say, 'life happens' - but fortunately with this alternative direction, I can still definitely say my *head is still very much in the cloud(s)!*
