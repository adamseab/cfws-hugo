DVLA Swansea

AWS Cloud Engineer
Associate - November 2022 - Present;
Junior - September 2020 - November 2022;

I&rsquo;m currently working as an Associate Cloud Engineer @ DVLA Swansea - I started as a Junior Engineer as a member of the 2020 Cloud Academy.
During that period, I passed my AWS Cloud Practitioner, Solutions Architect Associate and SysOps Administrator Associate exams and I&rsquo;m now working towards my Developer Associate.
I&rsquo;m part of a Squad that handles the implementation and upkeep of various tooling for all other internal cloud and app squads to use, as well as being hands on with the DVLA Kubernetes based infrastructure using AWS EKS.
I&rsquo;m also familiar with version control, CI/CD pipelines and their tools, such as Drone, Bitbucket, Spinnaker as well as AWS CodePipeline.
I am becoming more confident with Linux and its various flavours and experimenting with AWS Image Builder and I&rsquo;m also comfortable with AWS basics like EC2, S3, IAM and many others."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://comeflywithseab.com/_cv/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.f49d66caae9ea0fd43f21f29e71a8d3e284517ed770f2aa86fa012953ad3c9ef.css integrity="sha256-9J1myq6eoP1D8h8p5xqNPihFF+13Dyqob6ASlTrTye8=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://comeflywithseab.com/img/cloud.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://comeflywithseab.com/img/cloud.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://comeflywithseab.com/img/cloud.ico><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://comeflywithseab.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://comeflywithseab.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://comeflywithseab.com/_cv/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://comeflywithseab.com/_cv/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="ComeFlyWithSeab"><meta property="og:title" content="Curriculum Vitae"><meta property="og:description" content="Experience DVLA Swansea AWS Cloud Engineer Associate - November 2022 - Present; Junior - September 2020 - November 2022;
